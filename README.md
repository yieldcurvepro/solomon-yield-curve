## Salomon Brothers Series: Understanding the Yield Curve

The Salomon Brothers' "Understanding the Yield Curve" series (1995) remains influential
in fixed-income markets for introducing sophisticated yield curve analysis concepts to
practitioners. The series popularized key concepts like forward rate analysis, duration
extension strategies, and convexity bias among institutional investors and portfolio
managers. Its clear explanation of complex fixed-income mathematics helped establish
modern yield curve trading and relative value frameworks still used today.
